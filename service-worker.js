The 3rd floor is equipped with adjustable workstations, monitors, and office rooms for technical office hours and VC pitch sessions—everything you need for a productive hackathon! The 4th floor will include food stations, sleeping areas for when you need a late-night rest, and fun activities to let off steam. Lunches, Dinner, and Breakfast will be served at the venue, and snacks, coffee, and Red Bulls will always be in full supply!

Technical office hours: Two veteran Solana Developers will be onsite to help answer questions and their time can be booked through the two days for technical support.

VC pitch feedback sessions: VC's will be available during two time slots where you can get 1:1 direct feedback on your pitches.

Final Pitch: You will have a chance to pitch your project to the panel of judges (5 min pitch per team). Judges will vote to select a winning team in each of 3 categories.

PRIZES & TRACKS:
$15k+ prize pool split across three tracks:

- Decentralized Finance & Payments
- Consumer Apps & NFTs
- Public Goods

Who can apply?

You can apply as an individual or also join with a pre-existing team. Teams & individuals with pre-existing projects are welcome to join, but judges will only review the work that is developed during the 24 hours.

Inexperienced devs are welcome and encouraged to apply, there will be ample technical support and experienced devs to join forces with.

Applications will be approved on a rolling basis and spaces are limited, make sure to apply ASAP.

It closes the gap between a hacker house (super small, long time period) and a conference, and enables more depth, personal connection and exchange through co-living and not being constrained by time as much as with a usual conference. This combined with bringing together different fields of technological innovation and coordination (Distributed Systems, Cryptography, AI, Neuroscience, etc.) creates a unique environment where unforeseen novel ideas and concepts can emerge and flourish.

As the world is starting to embrace crypto and it is becoming more apparent that a lot of economic activity is moving on-chain, we want to reinforce the notion of a multi-chain world.

As the leading interoperability platform for multichain bridges and applications, Wormhole embodies this sentiment to the fullest. This is why we want to facilitate a place for the Wormhole community and ecosystem partners to connect, exchange, and advocate the vision of a 'web of web3'.

Expect a full day of workshops, presentations, panels, as well as games, music, food and drinks.

Agenda coming soon. Please RSVP.

We present:

**AI x Hope: Towards Futures of Human-AI Interdependence**

We stand at a crucial point in shaping how Human-AI cooperation will evolve and are witnessing the birth of a New Internet. We aim to approach this flippening with [Existential Hope](https://www.existentialhope.com/), and foster futures where humans and machines coexist to flourish ✨.

Our belief is that a healthy and harmonious development of decentralized artificial general intelligence (AGI) can arise from an enlightened vantage point. Specifically, we hope to empower builders, researchers, creators and investors exploring positive futures and protocols at the intersection of AI, crypto and creativity, with AI x Hope as an enabler for coordination in sharing technical, research-based and values-aligned perspectives.

We will converge through panel discussions, keynotes and workshops and think far and wide on the ways to align the nascent AI x crypto space for this new paradigm, where our collective synergy—in data, values and protocols—is all we need.

Hosted by [Seed Club Ventures](https://seedclub.ventures/), [Newcoin.org](http://newcoin.org/), and [Foresight Institute](https://foresight.org/).
